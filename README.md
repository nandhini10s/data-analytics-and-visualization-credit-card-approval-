CREDIT CARD APPROVAL PREDICTION: DATA ANALYTICS FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND DECISION-MAKING USING PYTHON

LIBRARIES USED- Pandas, Statsmodels, Sklearn 

The Jupyter Notebook contains descriptive statistics, correlation, data processing, train test split, Logistic regression, model prediction, model evaluation through accuracy score, confusion matrix and classification report.
The influence of certain variables like debt, income, credit rating, employment status on credit card approval is also analysed. 
The train test split and model prediction provide the credit card approval predicted value which is in turn used to depict the accuracy score, confusion matrix and an overall classification report.
